# Welcome to Infectious Grooves

Since being established in 2000 we have delivered 1000's of fun and educational drumming workshops for all ages and all abilities. Working extensively in education we have trained 100's of classroom and nursery teachers.

The workshops are hands on engaging sessions with every participant energetically taking part on their instrument. The training sessions are practical and interactive, packed with creative ideas that fully equip teachers to use percussion in a highly effective way.

## Drumming for Excellence  
An innovative training programme for teachers that combines rhythm and recall to create a powerful teaching method that appeals to every style of learning. [Click here for more information](http://www.drummingforexcellence.org/).
